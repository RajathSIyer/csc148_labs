Flight Roster
=============

Context: An airline reservation system

Each seat has a unique name, like "17C" and is either in business class or
economy. Passengers have booking IDs (a mix of letters and numbers). When they
book a seat, they request their preferred class (business or economy) and are
given any seat in that class. If the class is full, their booking is
unsuccessful. This airline gives passengers no choice about their specific seat.
We want to be able to report on how full a flight is: the percentage of seats
that are booked in economy, in business class, and overall
